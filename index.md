I am a mechanical engineering major and I am graduating in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC120L labs

Lab 9 part 1 - In this lab, Andrew, my lab partner, made it very easy to communicate so when we did struggle, it wasn’t just one of us working on it. I found it interesting how all we were coding was a program that scanned document files for misspelled words, similar to grammarly. I believe it was pretty basic, but in my opinion gave me a good look into what programming a grammar tool would be like.

Lab 6 part 2 - I didn’t necessarily love this lab, but I did find it amusing that it was all for a card game. In terms of enjoyment I really liked how my professor taught me to play blackjack to understand the code better, because as a result I fixed a logic error we had when we misunderstood what the TODO was asking us to do. Resulting in it having to end/win at 21, not any number besides that.

Lab 7 part 1 - This lab was fun because I have to deal with the street sweepers at my house all the time so it reminded me of the worry about getting a ticket. It was interesting seeing how code looks when implementing the parking times of when a vehicle can and cannot park in a certain spot. I look forward to doing programs that require this kind of code, I kind of enjoy it and don’t see it as laborious as the other codes in other labs.
