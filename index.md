## Favorite CPSC120L Labs

• Lab 9 part 1 
Andrew, my lab partner, made it very easy to communicate in this lab, so when we struggled, it wasn’t just one of us working on it. I found it interesting how all we were coding was a program that scanned document files for misspelled words, similar to Grammarly. I believe it was pretty basic, but in my opinion gave me a good look into what programming a grammar tool would be like.

• Lab 6 part 2 
I didn’t necessarily love this lab, but I did find it amusing that it was all for a card game. In terms of enjoyment, I liked how my professor taught me to play blackjack to understand the code better because, as a result, I fixed a logic error we had when we misunderstood what the TODO was asking us to do. This results in it having to end/win at 21, not any number besides that.

• Lab 7 part 1 
This lab was fun because I always had to deal with the street sweepers at my house, so it reminded me of the worry about getting a ticket. It was interesting to see how the code looks when implementing the parking times for when a vehicle can and cannot park in a particular spot. I look forward to doing programs that require this kind of code. I enjoy it and don’t see it as laborious as the codes in other labs.
